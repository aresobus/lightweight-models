# Pose Detection in the Browser: PoseNet Model

## Deprecation Notice

**Important:** This package has been deprecated. We recommend using the newer and more robust [Pose Detection package](https://github.com//lightweight-models/tree/master/pose-detection) for future projects involving pose detection in the browser.

The new pose detection package provides improved performance, enhanced accuracy, and support for additional models beyond PoseNet, ensuring better alignment with current and future needs in web-based pose detection applications.

Please refer to the new [pose-detection package documentation](https://github.com//lightweight-models/tree/master/pose-detection) for detailed information on getting started, usage examples, and API descriptions.

### Migrating to the New Pose Detection Package

If you are currently using PoseNet, we strongly encourage you to migrate to the new pose detection package to take advantage of these improvements. The new package supports a straightforward migration process with similar API structures, which should minimize changes required in your existing projects.

For detailed guidance on the migration process, please visit the [pose-detection package repository](https://github.com//lightweight-models/tree/master/pose-detection).

Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to seeing how you implement pose detection in your projects using the new package!
